# about
Hi, I’m David, and I live in Karlsruhe, Germany. Thanks for visiting my site.
I work as an iOS developer for a German drugstore chain called "dm" which is among Germany's most popular brands.
We are currently building the [Mein dm App](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/mein-dm-deutschland/id1186271926).

In my freetime I like to play soccer or build iOS/macOS applications using Swift.
Here are some of my latest projects:

* [AboutWindowController](https://github.com/dehlen/AboutWindowController)
* [Read Later iOS/macOS app](https://dehlen.github.io/readingtimeapp)
* [Secret Ingredient (Recipe Manager)](https://dehlen.github.io/secretingredientapp/)
* [SPM License Generator](https://github.com/dehlen/SPMLicenses)
