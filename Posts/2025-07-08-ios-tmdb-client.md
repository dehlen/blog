Frustrated by the ads and clunky experience of IMDB, I decided to create a more user-friendly alternative: an iOS app that leverages the powerful API of themoviedb.org. This app allows users to search for and gather information on their favorite TV shows, movies, and actors, all while providing a seamless experience.
This project not only serves as a replacement for IMDB but also provides me with an up-to-date platform to gain experience with the latest APIs, functioning as a showcase app for anyone interested in seeing my work.

## Key Features

- Search Functionality: Effortlessly find movies, TV shows, and actors with a simple search interface.
- Watchlist: Keep track of what you want to watch by adding movies, TV shows, or even single episodes to your personalized watchlist.
- Beautiful Animations: Built with SwiftUI, the app features stunning animations that enhance the overall user experience.
- iOS and iPadOS Compatibility: Enjoy a tailored experience whether you're on your iPhone or iPad.

## Why SwiftUI?

SwiftUI has allowed me to create a visually appealing and responsive app with less code and more functionality. The framework's declarative syntax makes it easy to implement beautiful animations and transitions, ensuring that users have an engaging experience.

## Video or didn't happen

Without further ado here is a video that will showcase the app in action, highlighting its animations and user interface. I am happy to receive any feedback on my take.
